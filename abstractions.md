# Abstrations

## Wednesday

## Keynote - Finding Our Path to Digital Autonomy

- Average electric car has 100 million lines of code

- Research paper - Killed by Code: Software Transparency in Medical Devices

    - Soap dispensers
    - Self-driving cars

Devices requiring your data to be sent to a central place
    - Fitbit
    - "Smart" toothbrushes

"I Agree" - Dima Yarovinsky

## Your Work Has Moral Implications

- Target - try to tell if a customer is pregnant, even if she doesn't want people to know
    - Target found out about teen pregnancy

Ethical codes
- don't deal with power imbalance
- are good with what NOT to do, but not with what to do
- are not really used in practice

What can we do?
- Employment at will
- Be accountable
- Unionize

Own the work

Create a Defendable Position
- Work in a team
- Create psychological safety in a team
- Demand accountability for team
- Build savings
- Join professional organizations
- Consider unionizing

What about now?
- Talk to higher-ups 
    - Get the team on board
- Scope change is your friend
- Fight a delaying action

Brass Tacks
- Do anything *but* that thing
- Blow the whistle
- Look for a new job
- Walk out

Malpratice - James Spruell & Mustafa Kamal

## Code Reviews - That's A Great Idea!

What should you be reviewing?
- Code you did not work on

Style - most controversial

When to review

Make reviews part of the culture

Soft skills matter

Assure positive intent*

Bias in reviews

Have expectations for conduct

## Testing - I don't think you know what that word means

Industry doesn't have a commmon agreement on what testing is

Testing pyramid

Teams that test
- focus on interfaces
- decrease cyclomatic complexity

Microservice testing

Non-functional tests

Avoid "test environments" as much as possible

## Games UX

A Theory of Fun - Raph Kester

## Working With A Team in 12 timezones

Elastic

How to pay someone where I don't know the tax code?

Distributed, not remote

Trust your employees - extend to team organization

### Communication Tools

#### Synchronous

Slack
Zoom

#### Async

Github
Gmail


Default Open

Default Distributed

1:1's are important

Different Cultures

Hiring Carefully

Hire Slow, Fire Seldom

Space, Time

01.01/FORMAT

We all have an accent

Assume good intent


# Day 2

## Rapid Prototyping with GatsbyJS

Why Gatsby?
- React
- GraphQL - query language, *not* a framework

Design Systems
- Atoms
- Molecules
- Organizations
- Pages

Functional CSS

```
npm install -g gastby cli

gatsby new project-name

cd project-name

npm install

gatsby develop
```

Prototype @ component level and page level

## Seven Deadly Sins

Tech debt - little things over time will slow you down - FRICTION

Morale Debt - risking emotional safety in the name of shipping

Hope Creep - Allowing aspiration estimates to hide the true cost of an effort

To deal with:
- Remove isolation
- Plan more granularly
- Always be shipping
- Go Home

Empathy Debt - Training teams to think of real-world users as stress cases

Limit Scope - we can't make everyone happy

Meet Your Users
- Build diverse teams
- Participate in user training
- Build user validation into schedule

Contentment Debt
- Always reaching for the next best tool
- Politics-Oriented Development - "Why can't we just" feature planning

No budget is limitless

`Lean UX` by Jeff Gothelf & Josh Seiden

It is not "brave" to embrace anti-patterns

Take pride in failure
- Experimentation
- Specialists

## Designing Trust

### Definitions

Data trust - sum of data transparency, value delivery, and consequence acceptance

Growing data privacy landscape
- Growth in data
- Growth in regulations
- Positive sum opportunities

Facial Recognition

Progressive Disclosure
- collecting information only when you need it

Design to make it easy to know what's going on

[grammarly](https://grammarly.com)

I am the *data subject*

I *own* that data

## The times They Are-A-Changin'

Things changing fast
- How we build software
- Open source
- Our idea of software engineers

We all know hiring is difficult

There's a shortage of tech workers

We need to adopt culturally to make room for lots more developers

Existing devs are burning out

Obv, increased diversity would help

Increased diversity = increasted productivity


# Day 3

## You Don't Need A SPA

Maintainability
- JS frameworks are disposable

Why accesibility is a problem
- Mucking with the DOM

SPA - App Delievered to client through a single page load

### Security
- Security is pushed to end of dev cycle
- Security is pused to infosec

Securing *our* network from malicious intent, not *our customer's*

Your SPA is a virus

What do we do now?
- SSE
- HTML5
- CSS3
- StackOverflow

Imagine a world where we're not coupled to the browser


## Sean Kelly

### Communication
- Tools like slack & confluence are *NOT* the communication, they are just tools

### Team Lead
- Sieve - lets good interactions through, and blocks bad ones
- "shit umbrella" meatphor is not great
- Up to engineers to develop collaborative relationships
- Don't let boredom with tech keep you from learning (e.g. spoken language)
