# Measuring success: Making sure your product organizations ship valuable code

Defining success - in order to measure, you need to know what success looks like

First, we consider business goals

Then, translate into product goals

Product goals include quality in general
- Accuracy
- Stability and scale

Some metrics are qualitative

While many are quantitative
- DB data
- Analytics and interactions

What happens if wrong metric types are used?
- If overuse DB data
  - Inefficient DB usage & maintenance
  - Engineering effort to maintain
- If overuse analytics / heatmaps
  - Miss most valuable business questions (source of truth)
  - Difficult to repurpose data for AI models down the road
  - Biased data or limited size samples

### Case studies

Onboarding
- Use A/B testing to optimize sign-up flows and app education

Point earning & redemption improvement
- Find out why they redeem the points

# Accounts as a Service: Why we have 50+ AWS accounts, and why you should too

Why you might do the same

- Allow devs/teams to experiment
- Ensure that they don't harm others
- Centralizes control, billing
- Good practice for managing/promoting workloads

Goals
- Limit big bills
- Automate

Control tower - Amazon's enterprise scale multi-account solution

AWS Organizations

**Always use multi-factor auth**

Allow vs Deny SCPs
- Don't apply Deny All at root of organization
