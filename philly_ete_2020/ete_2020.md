# How Robotics, Augmented & Virtual Reality Will Make Us Human Again

Greatest epidemic - loneliness

New normal
- Digital transformation is no longer a luxury, but a necessity
- Work life: hybrid work from home and office structure
- Upskill labor workforce to be tech trained
- Evolved leadership: managing fluid workforce
- Productivity valued more than clocked hours

For the first time in history, technology is:
- Advanced
- Accessible
- Automated

Collaborative robots (cobots)
- Sanitizing hospitals
- Logistics

Benefits
- Promote workers into cobot technicians
- Encourages team members to utilize soft skills
- Increase efficiency of human idle time up to 85%
- Increase safety at the workplace

Companion robots
- Sofia
- Little Sofia
- Whitney

Your brain cannot discern the different between alternate and physical realities

Case studies - VR experiences
- Reverses mental health disorders
- Mitigates brain degenerative diseases
- Better than traditional physical and mental therapies

Our future - **convergence of realities**

Physically distancing, but socially connecting

# Measuring success: Making sure your product organizations ship valuable code

Defining success - in order to measure, you need to know what success looks like

First, we consider business goals

Then, translate into product goals

Product goals include quality in general
- Accuracy
- Stability and scale

Some metrics are qualitative

While many are quantitative
- DB data
- Analytics and interactions

What happens if wrong metric types are used?
- If overuse DB data
  - Inefficient DB usage & maintenance
  - Engineering effort to maintain
- If overuse analytics / heatmaps
  - Miss most valuable business questions (source of truth)
  - Difficult to repurpose data for AI models down the road
  - Biased data or limited size samples

### Case studies

Onboarding
- Use A/B testing to optimize sign-up flows and app education

Point earning & redemption improvement
- Find out why they redeem the points

# Accounts as a Service: Why we have 50+ AWS accounts, and why you should too

Why you might do the same

- Allow devs/teams to experiment
- Ensure that they don't harm others
- Centralizes control, billing
- Good practice for managing/promoting workloads

Goals
- Limit big bills
- Automate

Control tower - Amazon's enterprise scale multi-account solution

AWS Organizations

**Always use multi-factor auth**

Allow vs Deny SCPs
- Don't apply Deny All at root of organization

# Humanizing Technology: What Accessible Design Offers Us

Accessibility - a measure of how *inclusive* your product is

2 design approaches:
- Curb cut effect
- Inclusive design

Accessible design has the ability to create business opportunities

What is SRE?
 
What is DevOps?
 
Who are SREs?
- Rare combo of sysadmin and programming skills, making them hard to find and hire
- Do not own your service in production for you, but during an incident, they bring unique and specific skills that are critically important
- Focus on automating repetitive tasks that do not add value and smoothing out how an application/service/system gets to and runs in prod, aka "Toil"
 
What is toil?
 
*"Toil is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly as a service grows."*
 
What is not toil?
- Some manual tasks are not toil, and have meaningful value in a process
- Administrative busywork is "overhead", not Toil
- Other examples in the real world: security training and protocols, HR requirements
 
The Four Golden Signals
- Latency
- Traffic
- Errors
    - Explicit: Non-200 response codes
    - Implicit: Invalid responses sent back
- Saturation
 
Availability
- This is not about your service's 9s
- No one cares if your service is "up" if they can't use it
- You must measure the success of your users/customers at the most remote ponit possible
- Request Success Rate (successful requests/total requests)
    - At the client, if you have can
    - At the Load Balancer, otherwise
 
SLIs, SLOs, SLAs
- You must define the right metrics for measuring the health of your system
- You must define the appropriatte values to measure success in your system
- You should provide customers with a reasonable expectation of level of service, **if possible**
 
SLAs should be tiered
- If you try to provide one level of service to all customers, you and your customers will both suffer
- Create 2-3 tiers of your SLA for different customer archetypes
- Should you onboard every customer?
- Should you request that a customer no longer use your service?
 
Know when it's okay to say no to a customer
 
If you can't talk to your leadership about when it's a bad idea to do something, that's a cultural red flag
 
Be able to talk about when a customer is no longer reasonably using your service
 
Error Budgets
- The inverse of your SLO, and helps you define how fast/often you can deploy
- Sets the bar for when team effort shifts to/from feature development to resilience tasks
- At what point is it counterproductive to chase availability?
- Not a strict rule, but business priorities shouldn't always override them
- If you do not burn it on incidents, you should intentionally burn it to validate that there are no improper dependencies on your service
 
# Serverless, Schmerverless... Why Should I Care?
 
Learning serverless takes longer than a week
 
A lot of complex configuration for the beginner
 
Why do it?
- Move quickly and get stuff done? Once you know it
- Avoid playing for idle servers
- Avoid managing server OSes, application servers
- Lower costs than legacy application
 
Some serverless options
- Manually, via CloudFormation or Terraform
- Using AWS SEerverless SAM
- Using the Serverless Framework
- Using a stronger abstraction, such as Architect
 
Lambdas
- Async events
- REST endpoints
 
Lambdas are single-threaded
 
Criteria for serverless tooling/frameworks:
- Well-documented
- Wide adoption
- Great examples
- Doesn't increase cognitive load
