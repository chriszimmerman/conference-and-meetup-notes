# Coding the Future

What does the future of tech look like?

What skills will a developer need?

Cloud
Augmented reality
Virtual reality
Wearables - bio tracking
Blockchain
Big data
Retail automation
Smart home automation
Smart cities
    -driverless cars will only need 10% of existing cars
        -most of the time, cars are not utilized; they're just idle
    -public safety
    -education
Biointegration - implants
Space
AI
    -NLP
    -Object recognition
    -Eye tracking

# Driving Technical Change Within Large Organizations

-Run old system in parallel

-Focus on simplest user flows first

## Wedge strategy
    -start with subset of functionality
    -incrementally add flows
    -fully replaced

## Phased rollouts
## Reverse engineering legacy systems
    -HAR files - save all network calls made from browser
## Monitor your unreliable dependencies

## Environment fanout

## Choose your tradeoffs
    -complex infrastructure vs complex code

## Grassroots tactics
    -hip chat (previous communication was through email only)
    -cloud infrastructure
        -started small, grew organically, organization-wide adoption
## Splitting code & feature deployment
## Identify and neutralize stakeholders' perceived risks

# Empathy as a Service

- 1 in 5 Americans are living with mental illness at any given time
- 1 in 11 live with diabetes
- 1 in 12 live with asthma
- 1 in 5 live with arthritis


-burnout is a form of depression

- 56% of US adults do not receive mental health treatment

[Open Sourcing Mental Illness](https://osmihelp.org)

"Welcome Wagon"
    -take employee out to dinner/lunch. avoid alcohol
    -invite them to do things with you (e.g. volunteer, join a book club)

[OSMI handbooks](https://leanpub.com/u/osmi)
[Mental Health First Aid](https://mentalhealthfirstaid.org)

The ALGEE action plan
    -Assess for risk of suicide or harm
    -Listen non-judgementally
    -Give reassurance and information
    -Encourage appropriate professional help
    -Encourage self-help and other support strategies

Support marginalized people in the tech industry
Fully embrace neurodiversity



# GraphQL

GraphQL is a new way to interact with APIs
Solves certain problems caused by RESTful APIs

What is REST
    -representational state transfer

GraphQL allows you to specify the information you want to retrieve
    -feature called "introspection" - like Reflection

    Three types of calls
        -queries
        -subscriptions - Read
        -mutations - Write

# Docker

Fundamental concepts
    -dockerfile
        -build one container
    -docker-composer
        -stack multiple containers so they work together

Explore with less effort
Revise with more confidence - check into version control
Deploy with less effort

`docker run hello-world`

Pull
`docker pull mysql:5`

List images
`docker image ls`

Show 
`docker ps`

`docker ps -a`

`docker image rm [IMAGE ID]`


Container - a black-box that runs things

Dockerfile - the "blueprint" to create runnable black-boxes on demand

The application is NOT installed into the host. It is ONLY installed onto the container.
Application is available to the host without changes to the host.
Discard the container if it is ugly, or keep it if nice. Ship the container to run the app elsewhere.

Docker commands
FROM
RUN
ENTRYPOINT

-docker-compose

Docker hygiene
- use version control
- user Dockerfile ENV command to embed version identifier into image
- Tag important production ???
- Stack specific elements in stack tree; common configurations into Dockerfile
- Only deploy images into prod that have matching image with tag already deployed into your image registry/repo
- Simplify repetitive operations with reusable scripts
- Plan on re-booting your docker service and/or your stacks and/or your host computers periodically
- UID of user/group owning shared files matters
- Know the source of your container

# Why Open Source Is Important

Make sure your open source repo has a license
Culture
Community
People - collaborating on a common vision
You can only do this with transparency

# Mentoring

## Know your audience

### Connect with your audience
Why should they listen to you?
What can you offer them?

### What motivates them?

### Set expectations

### Empathize with your audience
Level of understanding
Don't assume
    -if it's too low, you may come off as condescending

### Remove distractions
What might get in teh way of learning?

### Use live coding sparingly


### Remember your journey
- Where are they in their journey?
- Nobody hits a home run their first time

### Smash jargon

## Examples that connect

### Use examples people already understand
    -stop using foo/bar/baz - not helpful - use conrete example
    -be practical

### Why? So what?
When will I use this?

### One concept at a time

### Model good behavior
    -good variable names

### Be flexible

### Mistakes happen
    -When you make a mistake, explain what went wrong and how to fix it

### Do it wrong on purpose

### Good examples stand on their own

## Know what to hold back

### Answer the question that was asked
-Offering extra information can be confusing

### Nuance isn't always helpful
-Teach the most common situations

### Teach the pool, not the ocean
-Know what is relevant in the moment and what is best saved for later

### Don't cover too much material

## Foster a love of learning

### Reward curiosity

### "I don't know, let's find out"
-This is a magic phrase

### Show, don't tell

### Test your expectations

### "Great question."
-"I love your instincts."

### Always give at least one right answer
-When you pose questions, are you getting a wall of silence?

### Celebrate progress
-Positive feedback encourages growth

### Move about
Teaching concepts through movement makes for unforgettable experiences

### We learn by teaching
Teaching reinforces what we learned

### Your students learn by teaching, too

## Q&A 

How to teach elementary school kids? Make it fun

How do deal with offensive/exclusive language? 
    -Create your own curriculum is one way
    -Create affinity groups

How do you teach frameworks when you don't know the level of experience?
    -Tailor to people at all different levels
    -Start beginner & work your way up

# Chatbots in Elixir

## UI
### Discoverability
    -what they can do
### Validation
    -say invalid input is valid
    -let them know what input is valid
###  Selection
    -narrow selection down to several choices (top 3, top 2)

## Best practices
### Gender neutral
### Beer test
    -have bot be self-deprecating and admit that it will make mistakes
### Different responses
### Use their surroundings
    -Feels more personable
### Fallback
    -Have a lot of fallback responses (in the 100 range)

# Cultivating Community: Building Powerful Relationships By Communicating With Empathy 

Everyday communication is incredibly chaotic
Chaotic communication is detrimental to successful relationships

Stuttering
    -acknowledging the issue
        -taking ownership of it
        -I'm allowing there to be a conversation about it

Transparency is important because
    -I'm allowing you to be a part of the conversation
    -You feel more comfortable sharing your vulnerabilities with me

What is empathy?
    -The ability to understand and share the feelings of another person

Love as a noun is an *idea*
Love as a verb is a *choice*

Empathy as a noun is an *idea*
Empathy as a verb is a *choice*

What is *not* empathy?
    -Being nice
    -Being a doormat

Why is *empathy* important?
    -92% of employees believe that empathy undervalued at their company
    -87% of CEO's believe a compnay's financial performance is tied to empathy in the workplace
    -90% of employees are more likely to stay with a compnay that empathized with their needs
    -80% of employees are willing to work longer hours for an empathetic employer

Empathy drives the company's bottom line

Building powerful relationships with empathy begins with communication

## How do you communicate with empathy?
Speak their language
Listen
How do you listen?
    -Maintain eye contact
    -Take a deep breath before responding
    -Paraphrase what they said

## True connection happens not when we're speaking, but when we're listening

## Empathy helps everyone know their role on the team

## Empathy helps people empower their teammates

## Empathy lays the foundation for an inclusive and diverse community
