### Standards

What?
- Guidelines
- Conventions
- Programming Styles
- Best Practices

Why?
- Catch common errors early
- Readability
- Predictable
- Ease learn curve for new devs

Who?
- TEAM if possible
    - Leave your ego out the door
- You if you're the SME
    - Find the sweet spot

When?
- At the beginning of a project
- In the middle, it's ok, but it requires more attention
- Taking over a project

### Linting & Formatting

- JS Hint
- standard JS
- XO
- Prettier

- mostly in a config file (i.e. .eslintrc)

#### Enforcing
git hooks via [husky](https://npm.im/husky)

### Examples of Implementations
Guides
    - Airbnb
    - Google

### Configuration
    - eslint - recommended

### Antipatterns (oh no you didn't!)
- Disable comments
    - `// eslint-disable-next-line`
- Ignore commit hooks

### What about the monsters?
- ego (yourself)
- educate
    - if you're the expert on the team, bring others up to your level

### Takeaways
    - Always have a plan
    - Document the h*ck out of it
    - Enforce & delegate; it's a *team effort*
    - Continuous improvement
